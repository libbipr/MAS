        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Visual Aids and Written Notes:</strong>Tools such as diagrams, lists, or even a recorded note can help you communicate more effectively. Don't hesitate to use whatever tools make you feel most comfortable.

        <li>
          <strong>Practice Self-Care:</strong>If appointments make you feel anxious, use relaxation techniques like deep breathing or listen to calming music beforehand. It's okay to ask for breaks during long appointments.
