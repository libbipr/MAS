      <h1>Self‑Advocacy in Medical Settings</h1>
      <p>
        Being your own advocate is key to ensuring you receive the care you need. Here are some tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare in Advance:</strong> Write down your symptoms, questions, and concerns before your appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Clear and Direct:</strong> Clearly communicate your needs and any sensory preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask for Clarification:</strong> If you do not understand something, ask your provider to explain it in plain language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bring Support:</strong> Consider having a trusted person accompany you, especially if you feel anxious.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, you have the right to receive respectful and clear communication during your appointments.
